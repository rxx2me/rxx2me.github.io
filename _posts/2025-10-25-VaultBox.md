# VaultBox Forensics Write-up

> **Category:** Forensics  
> **Prompt:** VaultBox is a "secure vault" app that claims to store passwords, files, and images. At first glance, it looks like a normal vault manager… but something feels off.  
> **Artifact:** [⬇️ app-debug.apk](/assets/file/writeup/VaultBox/app-debug.apk?raw=1)  
> **Flag format:** FlagY{...}

## Intro

VaultBox looks clean and “secure” but the whole thing felt staged. 
I treated it like a prop vault: open it up, poke the lining, and see what falls out.

---

## Challenge Description

Given an Android APK . The goal: find the flag hidden somewhere inside the app package. 

---

## Steps

1) I opened the APK directly in JADX .

2) From the left tree, I jumped straight to the Resources → assets → photos folder.

3) One file stood out: assets/photos/The_Butcher's_Kill_Tools.webp.

4) In the XMP block , there was a Base64 string starting with RmxhZ1l7, which is a giveaway for FlagY{.

5) The full blob: RmxhZ1l7ZDIwNzZlY2M3NTk0OTlhNjRmYWVjN2RmMjg0ZGI4NTJ9

6) Decoding it gives the flag.

## Output:
```
FlagY{d2076ecc759499a64faec7df284db852}
```
